Moradin's Fist is the largest mountain on [Ahrda](/Ahrda "wikilink")
standing at a little over 8,800 meters tall, located in
[Brend](/Brend "wikilink"), and is home to the dwarven civilization.

## Overview

For as long as dwarves have recorded history, Moradin's Fist has been
home to dwarves. Currently, dwarves occupy all of the mountain from sea
level to the tip of the mountain. Most of the mountain is occupied by
living areas which is divided into two main areas: the smaller Palatial
Level and the Dwarven Boroughs.

    Levels are not to scale.

## Off-Limits Levels

Nothing is known to the public about these restricted levels. The only
observation that has been made is that only high ranked officials and
certain religious figures are allowed in these heavily guarded levels.

## Palatial Levels

The Palatial levels are largely occupied by the royal palace as well as
the higher class living arrangements for officials and well-to-do
dwarves. A major feature of the Palatial levels is the Palatial Plateau,
an enormous excavation in the side of the mountain, open to sunlight and
home to many gardens and the main palatial grounds. The Palatial Level
occupies approximately the same volume as 300 regular dwarven borough
levels, but does not contain any levels per se as it is simply an
enormous cavernous structure.

To enter or work on the palatial levels, one must present the proper
documentation to dwarven officials stationed at checkpoints between the
boroughs and palatial levels.

## Borough Levels

Since Moradin's Fist is home to most of the dwarven population of
[Ahrda](/Ahrda "wikilink"), it contains many boroughs within. Most of
the mountain is devoted to these borough levels, approximately 3,500
levels or so, although this number is a rough estimate. The boroughs are
settled in the remnants of old mineshafts, which have been expanded and
tightly packed with structures. While Moradin's Fist is considered to be
one enormous city, it is divided into many different boroughs, ranging
from a prosperous upper-class near the palatial level to soot-filled
slums near the upper mines. The further one travels down through the
boroughs, the poorer the neighborhoods seem. Though this would certainly
lead to class conflict in some other societies, most dwarves do not feel
the urge to rebel against the system which has been in place for
thousands of years.

## Upper Mines

To enter the upper mines, once again, one must present the proper
documentation to dwarven officials stationed at checkpoints between the
boroughs and upper mines levels.

The upper mines are home to active dwarven mining activities; veins of
gold, platinum, copper, iron, and silver are all mined down here.
Moradin's Fist appears to be plentiful in rich ores and minerals, which
has given dwarven culture the upper hand in expansion on
[Ahrda](/Ahrda "wikilink") and sponsors new mining activities outside of
[Brend](/Brend "wikilink").

## Shallow and Deep Mines

Not much is known about the shallow and deep mines as entrance through
the upper mines to these levels is restricted to those with royal
permission. Since most of these excursions are secret, not much is known
about them. What has been observed, however, is that the luminous spores
which light the streets in the boroughs and palatial levels comes from
somewhere on these levels. Most other logistics originating from these
levels is shrouded in secrecy.

## The Great Staircase

Through the center of Moradin's Fist runs the Great Staircase, an
ancient stone-carved spiral staircase that twists down into the depths
below the mountain. Not much is known about this staircase, although it
seems that it is much more ancient the deeper it goes. Historians are
not sure where the staircase begins, though it is assumed it is
somewhere in the shallow mines. Though the Great Staircase is still the
most efficient mode of transportation for those traveling between *many*
borough levels, countless other staircases have been erected in between
individual levels, which don't require travel to the central
hub.
