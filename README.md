# Ahrda.info Backup

This repo is a backup of the wiki that used to be at Ahrda.info which contained
the information that I used to create my D&D campaigns. The site is now gone,
but I wanted to ensure that the content wasn't lost. So, here it is, though it
is unstructured, unlinked, and raw.

If there are images linked, they will be in the images directory. Some of them
are original creations or photos, some *borrowed* off Google Image search.

If you want to use any of it feel free. I'd love to know if anyone actually ends
up using this, shoot me a line at eddyluten at gmail dot com :)
