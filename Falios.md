By winning the [War for Freedom](/War_for_Freedom "wikilink"), Falios
gained its independence from [Brinnar](/Brinnar "wikilink") after the
province felt that its rulers became out of touch with its progressive
culture. Falios, like [Merion](/Merion "wikilink"), employs elections to
choose its leaders every seven years. Ever since gaining its
independence, the country has had a heavy focus on progress and
industry. It is the largest exporter in the world of wicker chairs,
horse buggies, mass-produced swords, and since recently, books on
self-improvement.
