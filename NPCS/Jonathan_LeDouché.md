Jonathan LeDouché got started in his career as a witch hunter,
specializing in dual wielding light crossbows. He was a decent witch
hunter, but focused too much on the technicalities and was socially
inept. Because of this, the witch hunting group he was part of rejected
him and started a new group without him. In spite, he attempted to start
a new witch hunting group with his favorite witch hunters, but this also
didn't work out as they again rejected him.

Destitute, LeDouché saw the opportunity of a lifetime when the [Human
Trinity](/Human_Trinity "wikilink") began rising to power in his area
and joined as soon as he figured out how. Currently, LeDouché enjoys a
middle management position and leads a small outfit of soldiers
stationed in [Rayna's Castle](/Rayna's_Castle "wikilink").
