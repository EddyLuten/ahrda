## Character Backgrounds

### Haunted One

From *Curse of Strahd*

You are haunted by something so terrible that you dare not speak of it.
You've tried to bury it and run away from it, to no avail. Whatever this
thing is that haunts you can't be slain with a sword or banished with a
spell. It might come to you as a shadow on the wall, a blood-curdling
nightmare, a memory that refuses to die, or a demonic whisper in the
dark. The burden has taken its toll, isolation you from most people and
making you question your sanity. You must find a way to overcome it
before it destroys you.

**Skill Proficiencies** Choose one of Aracana, Investigation, Religion,
or Survival

**Languages** Choose one exotic language (Abyssal, Celestial, Deep
Speech, Draconic, Infernal, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon)

*' Equipment*' Monster hunter's pack (see below), one trinket of special
significance (choose one or roll one on the Gothic Trinkets
table)

#### Feature: Heart of Darkness

Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable
horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear
you, commoners will extend yo every courtesy and do their utmost to help

even take up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself
facing an enemy alone.

dark moment, one fateful decision, or one tragedy. Now you feel a
darkness threatening to consume you, and you fear that there may be no

You have a knack for making your way in the deep places of the world.
You can recall the twists and turns of passageways and tunnels such that
you can always retrace your steps underground. You're also well
acquainted with foraging and survival in the Underdark, and can
determine when sources of food and water are safe to consume. You can

people in the Underdark, as long as sustenance is available in the area.

| 1   | You were once lost in the Underdark, and a group of kuo-toa helped you find your way out. You learned that there are kindly folk even among that otherwise mad race, and remain indebted to them for their aid.                                       |
| 2   | You once had the opportunity to meet a circle of myconids -- the mushroom folk of the Underdark. They offered you shelter and a chance to "meld" using their telepathic spores, and you have yearned ever since to repeat that experience.            |
| 3   | Once of your best friends in your youth was Morista Malkin, a shield dwarf and member of the Emerald Enclave. Though you haven't seen her in years, you heard she found her way to the reclaimed dwarf hold of Gauntlgrym.                            |
| 4   | You once worked for Davra Jassur, a Zhentarim "troubleshooter" recruiting promising new talent for the Black Network. She helped you get your start as an adventurer, and you owe her for that.                                                       |
| 5   | You have long had a curious recurring dream about visiting a vaulted stone library in the depths of the Underdark, and becoming lost in the endless lore it holds.                                                                                    |
| 6   | You studied with a deep gone alchemist and miner named Kazook Pickshine, who saved your life once when a magical experiment went awry. Last you heard, his family controlled some of the largest mines in the deep gnome settlement of Blingdenstone. |
| 7   | What little you know about the Underdark, you learned from living and fighting alongside the Feldrun clan of dwarves. You swore and honer debt to the clan before they joined the forces retaking Gauntlgrym and established themselves there.        |
| 8   | Years ago,k a vicious noble named Ghazim DuLoc was implicated in the death of someone you cared about. The crime was covered up, though, and DuLoc disappeared. Rumor has it the Zhentarim aided his escape, but you've sworn to find him one day.    |
| 9   | Years ago, you lost people you loved in a raid by creatures from the Underdark. They disappeared without a trace, either slain or taken into the depths, and you've always wondered whether they might still be alive and held as prisoners.          |
| 10  | You know the dwarf hold of Gauntlgrym well, having fought alongside the dwarves to help reclaim it. King Bruenor Battlehammer congratulated you on your valor and you know the price the dwarves paid in blood to regain their home.                  |
