Grimsy is a goblin NPC in [Dungeons &
Drunkards](/Dungeons_&_Drunkards "wikilink") whose entire family was
affected by the [Human Trinity](/Human_Trinity "wikilink"). His brothers
and sisters were burnt to death as he watched helplessly at the
[windmill outside Rayna's
Castle](/Dungeons_%26_Drunkards_Season_2_Concept#Encounter:_Windmill_Hill "wikilink").
He is hellbent on getting revenge against the Human Trinity and free his
remaining family who supposedly are being held captive.
