## Background (First-Person)

My name is Wrobi but you can call me Yofi, which means “good” in Gnomish
because, well, I’m kind of a goody two-shoes to be honest. I come from a
long line of tinkerers in the land of [Gerbilor](/Gerbilor "wikilink")
named after the great fuzzy cute Gerbili that helps us get around town
faster, and also powers some of the complex mechanisms we build. My
family is part of the [clan Urilin](/Clan_Urilin "wikilink"), known for
making the finest intricate mechanisms.

As I grew older, I wanted something new and exciting to do, so to my
luck there was a local wizard looking for an assistant to help him
create new potions and mechanical oddities. I grew more and more curious
of his magical books and at night when he would go to sleep I’d sneak
into his library and at candlelight, I’d read all about the different
schools of Magic, like Abjuration, Enchantment and Necromancy. A lot of
these things frightened me but also intrigued me. One night, my master
caught me reading and instead of punishing me, he sat me on the table
and asked me if I’d like to become his apprentice.

Since then, I’ve been slowly learning my craft and am eager to start a
new adventure and meet some fellow adventurer friends\! I’m so excited
to explore the world and learn all the things\!

I was so excited\! I’ve never ever dreamed of becoming my very own
wizard. I quickly wrote to my family back home and they were so excited.
They even had a party in my name. They sent me lots of things for my new
position. My father crafted a fine oak staff with an owl head carved on
the top and gold wire wrapping around it towards the bottom. My mother
sent me a royal blue robe, which fits a little big, but either way, it’s
really comfy\! My uncle sent me a pair of leather shoes to match the
royal blue robe - the shoes are also a inch too big. I think my family
overestimated how big I really am; I’m ONLY 4 feet tall and wear tiny
little clothes\!
