Once down the well, after some travel in complete darkness, there is a
sewer grate which has to be broken (STR 20), some rusted bars have to be
pulled out:

| Breaking the iron bars | DC 20 Strength (STR) |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- |

If the gang is carrying a torch, the flame will be much brighter due to
the sewer gasses. If they light a torch around here, they may cause an
explosion.

| 5% (1d20 crit) chance of explosion | 1d6 fire damage |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------- |

They travel for 10 more minutes in complete darkness:

After more traveling in complete darkness, the gang comes to a large
circular room where three sewer pipes meet; a hub:

Turns out, they don't have to swim. If someone heads in first, a black
pudding that lives just below the surface will attack. It's hungry after
surviving only on rats and whatever else is in the sewer for all these
years.

**Tunnels**

  - The left tunnel leads to underneath the barracks behind Jonathan
    LeDouché's office. They can hear Human Trinity soldiers talking
    about wanting to attend the rally, but have to stand guard. It's a
    dead end.
  - The right tunnel leads to the next encounter, a large open room (see
    below).

Overhearing the soldiers:

> Soldier 2: I can't believe we have to stand guard during the rally,
> this is bullshit.
> Soldier 1: Fuck LeDouché.
> LeDouché: I heard that, that's a mark going into your records\! Bring
> me a goblet of ale unless you want to make it two\!

Soldier 1 grumbles and walks
off.
