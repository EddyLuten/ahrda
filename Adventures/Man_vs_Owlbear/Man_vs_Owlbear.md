## Setting
The game begins with a people enslaved in mining camp in the mountains of the southeast corner of Brend. 
There is a sheer cliff face to the north. Waterfalls and raging rivers and steep sheer cliff down 40ft into rapids on the west and south. The east has dense forests from which the 15ft tall log fence bordering the entire camp stand. There is one gated river crossing to the south. 

This camp is home to the displaced people of Falkirk guarded by men and beast under the name of Riscromm Swordfury and the growing reach of Reidgate. Winter will set in soon and it will be no less harsh than the previous.

## Preface
The tension in Deirstahl, Brend and the once great Sivor Empire have increased in recent years. As Deirstahl advanced south on the Sivor Empire to help greater trade with Gerbilor and Brend it got some populations in Sivor up in arms - see [SivorEmpire](../../World/Regions/Sivor_Empire.md "wikilink"). Recently under the command of Riscromm Swordfury the military men of Reidgate started capturing villages. At first it was merely a warmongering fashion, these come and go and was contained to Sivor, extending south. Now advances were made into the neighboring regions. However, as Reidgate gained supplies, and influence their tactics grew. The first Deirstahlian city to fall was Falkirk.

Falkirk was a profitable town in the southern corner of Deirstall at the western edge of the Moradinian Plains and was a major trading city, speficially to Gerbilor and the southern Brendian dwarven artisans. The seige was quicker than most would expect, and the initial attack came from within. In days the city guard was dead, and the warriors of Reidgate were in the city walls. Swordfuries men went and gathered up any able individuals, the well versed they either recruited or killed. All experienced wizards, swordsmen, craftsmen, thieves, or likewise that could pose a threat to the occupations shared the same fate. 

The non combatant elderly, artisans, merchants were allowed to continue operating in the city. While Reidgate had been known to be savage in their ransacking of cities in Sivor, they took a different, more mature tactic in allowing the city some semblence of stability to the outside world. 

The apprentices, young capable men and women who were inexperienced combatants were rounded up and sent off in service or Reidgate. The majority of these were taking to their current camp in Brend. They are slaves, extracting minerals from the mountains from a mine that provided Reidgate plenty but was unsuitable for the likes of dwarves. Everyone is sent into the mine day after day, fed enough to keep their strength, and generally cared for as the mine needs to be productive. While guards are around the camp, patrols happen regularly, the lenght of time has caused their diligence to wane. Not to mention the few that escaped were generally ran south and were quickly set upon by dogs or harsh weather. None as of yet have made a clean break. 

This isn't to say that life in the camp isn't without issues. Injuries and death are relatively common, but nothing as great as the bite of the cold the previous winter. There weren't enough supplies to go around. Frostbite, illness and hypothermia caused the death of many. The ranks were replaced shortly after from other captive towns and villages as soon as the passes opened, but as the changing of seasons fast approaches and the supplies have not been bolstered above the numbers of the previous winter it is not looking good for the coming months.
