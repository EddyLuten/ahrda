Before the gang heads up the newly paved road, from the South, they
notice a group of 8 Human Trinity soldiers escorting a prisoner (Olwyn).
The soldiers are rough with her and push her towards a group of
crucified corpses. The soldiers cut down one of the corpses and it seems
as if they are getting ready to crucify their prisoner on the spot.

Meanwhile, from a safe distance, Straggo and Rockelby also see the same
thing happening, they may choose to engage.

Gang meets up and defeats the soldiers.

Olwyn can find all of her belongings on the soldiers'
corpses.
