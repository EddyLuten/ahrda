Come into a large opening where the sewer opens up into a room. It's
loud, much water rushing, there are some soldiers in this room, right
next to where the gang enters.

They are playing cards at a table and are not paying attention. They're
talking about how they're letting the recruits take the helm for a bit
while they're blowing off steam. There's a rickety bridge from the left
side of the room to the right side where the soldiers are. The soldiers
won't notice them (need to do checks for this).

There's a trap on the little staircase leading out of the water that
will set off an alarm if stepped on:

| Detection | DC 16 Perception (WIS)                               |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Disarming | DC 15 Disarm with thieves tools, DC 18 without (DEX) |
| Reward    | 100 XP รท 7 players = 15 XP/player                    |

After a few seconds, a soldier will enter the room carrying a couple of
beer tankards, and lock the door behind him -- he will likely spot the
gang.

Soldier Options:

  - If this soldier is not dispatched of, he will run off and warn his
    supervisor, locking the door behind him from the other side.
  - If the soldier is dispatched of, he will drop the key to the door in
    the river, and it will wash down the drain.

There's one door out of this room, and it's locked. The gang can spot
keys on the table where the guards are playing. This forces them to
either get stealthy or kill the
soldiers.
