If the Wiki seems overwhelming: don't panic\!

The Wiki is simply a way of keeping record, it's **not** mandatory
reading. There are only a few things that you really *have* to know, all
of which are on this page, so let's get started.

__TOC__

## Overview

  - Campaigns are played using the 5th edition of [Dungeons &
    Dragons](http://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/what-is-dd).
  - As long as you run it by the DM first to make sure it's balanced:
      - It's totally fine to use material from [Unearthed
        Arcana](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles-tags/unearthed-arcana).
      - It's totally fine to homebrew a class or use something you
        pulled from an online source.
      - It's totally fine to use material from previous editions or
        Pathfinder.
  - Campaigns take place in a fictional fantasy world called
    [Ahrda](World/Arhda.md).
  - The focus of the games tends to be more around Role Playing and
    story than combat.
  - It's probably a good idea to pick up a copy of the 5th edition
    Player's Handbook.

## Character Creation

  - Don't create a character to "fit in" with the campaign, create a
    character that you *want* to play and can identify with.
  - Create as much or as little backstory to your character as you want.
  - It's totally fine to rename things from the official documentation
    to fit your character better (reskinning).
  - Talk to the DM to find out what level your character should be, this
    will match the rest of the group.
  - Talk to the DM regarding starting gold, it will be a bit extra for
    you to match the rest of the group.
  - If you need help creating a character or are unsure of how to do it,
    talk to your DM or a player from your group.
  - You can use whichever of the methods in the Player's Handbook you
    want to determine your character's ability scores.
  - There are mobile apps which allow you to quickly create and level up
    your character. [This
    one](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fifth-edition-character-sheet/id967650851)
    is great for iOS.

## Physical Stuff

  - **Required:** an iron liver, because there will be much drinking.
  - **Required:** a character sheet, either digital or paper.
  - **Optional:** dice. You can borrow some if you need.
  - **Optional:** 5th edition Player Handbook. A digital copy can be
    provided.
  - **Optional:** a character mini, we *do* play with paper maps. You
    can borrow a mini if you don't have one.
