If the gang goes further down the hallway, there's a loud cheering
coming from the distance. If they watch, they can see a tall bald man
entering onto the stage and after the crowd quiets down, he begins his
speech.

> My brothers and sisters of the Human Trinity; thank you for joining me
> today in this great gathering. It has been six months since we began
> excising our *right judgement* against those who dare defile our
> beautiful human lands.
>
> *cheers*
>
> Regardless of nationality, humans are once again bonded together as
> one. Borders have been erased, flaccid leadership deposed and replaced
> with strong, *righteous*, Human Trinity men and women. We have proven
> once and for all the superiority of humans over non-humans -- *never*
> has the tri-country region been as peaceful and productive as it is
> now.
>
> *cheers*
>
> But we are far from done. The enemy has shown its monstrous face;
> pockets of resistance emerged and murdered many of our brothers and
> sisters. Even my own daughter, Mildred, fell victim to these monsters
> several months ago and was brutally murdered.
>
> *boos*
>
> When these beasts turn to murder our women in our own fatherland,
> something needs to be done. But fear not: soon these criminals will
> see justice and pay for their crimes against humankind.
>
> *applause*
>
> I am here tonight to tell you that public support is growing
> throughout the human territories, and tonight I'd like to introduce
> you to a man you already know. Everyone here is familiar with his
> greatness in the arena. Brothers and sisters, Orso Minor\!
>
> *crowd cheers loudly*

The bald man speaks again.

> Orso joins us in our movement to reclaim what is rightfully ours and
> expel those that resist us -- by force if required. Rest assured that
> we're developing a *permanent solution* to the non-human problem,
> something that rids us of this threat to our culture and our way of
> being once and for all. Thank you all and may the gods continue to
> bless our efforts.
>
> *crowd applauds and cheers*

If the gang stays around too long, the speech ends and the crowd of
hundreds will get an opportunity to spot them. This way is *not* the way
to go forward, rather it is better to go back to Le LeDouch√©'s den and
find the stairs going down into the dungeons beneath the castle that
holds the weapon. If they get spotted, a group of soldiers will chase
them and imprison them.
