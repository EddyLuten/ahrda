Once the gang comes out of the room, they will enter a large hallway.

**Possibilities:**

1.  If a soldier got away to alert their companions, a sizable group of
    soldiers lead by [Jonathan LeDouché](/Jonathan_LeDouché "wikilink")
    will show up to fight them.
2.  If the soldier did not get away, LeDouché will be stationed at a
    desk the room branching off the hallway with the same detachment of
    men currently sleeping.

If possibility \#2: The gang walks into the hallway, and almost
immediately, a stone tankard comes flying out a doorway and smashes
against the wall.

> "How many times do I have to tell you to serve my ale in a *copper*
> goblet?" a shrill voice yells from the doorway.
> "I'm sorry sir. I will fetch your goblet," an apologetic voice says.
> The sound of a heavy wooden door opening and closing.
> "I never had this problem when I was a *witch hunter*," the shrill
> voice yells.

If engaging LeDouché, the gang finds a note on his body describing "the
weapon":

He may or may not alert his men who are sleeping in the room adjacent.
This is a contingent of 8 soldiers (including JLD), mostly lower level
recruits. He may also tell his men to stand back until he's too hurt to
go on alone due to him being over-confident in his own
abilities.
