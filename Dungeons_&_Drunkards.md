## Setting

So far, the game takes place around the small town of [Crow's
Haven](/Crow's_Haven "wikilink") in the country of
[Brinnar](/Brinnar "wikilink"). The game started in the Seventh Age of
Melora, year 491.

## Games

The following game synopses are from notes and some video recordings,
and miss much detail. If you have any details to add, please do so.

### Game 1: July 3rd, 2015

Before the game started, each of the gang received [this
note](/Note_From_a_Friend "wikilink"), given to them by absolute
strangers. All of them went to the [Happy
Swine](/Happy_Swine "wikilink") in the town of [Crow's
Haven](/Crow's_Haven "wikilink"), and before they knew it, they were all
unconscious in the basement of the Happy Swine, about to be slaughtered.
All of them eventually managed to break free from their restraints and
murdered their way out into the sewers.

Although they had slipped down a sewer grate, there were still guards on
their heels, one of which got his head chopped off as he peeked down the
sewer grate where Braggish was waiting with his greataxe. There was only
one way out, a blocked off sewer pipe, which as it turned out, was
filled with a swarm of rats. After defeating the rats, Tillian and Yofi
scouted ahead through the pipe and saw two giant rats as they exited the
tunnel on the other end. They turned around immediately and informed the
others.

After some deliberation, the whole gang went ahead and murdered the
rats, who as it turned out, were the pets of two goblins living in the
sewers. The goblins pleaded for their lives, but since they were quite
rude (quite rude indeed), were slaughtered as well. Looking around, Orso
found the skeleton of a Dwarven girl, but since it wasn't valuable, he
tossed it over his shoulder into the river of piss and shit. Tillian
found a silver necklace, but since it wasn't gold, it ended up in the
same place. Yofi dove after both and recovered what she could, including
the necklace.

Eventually, they came to the surface and exited the sewers onto the
streets of Crow's Haven next to the Happy Swine tavern where they
obviously were drugged. With vengeance on their minds, they went inside
and beat the crap out of the owner and his Half-Orc bodyguard named Krom
but didn't kill either of them. Instead, they let Krom go and got the
tavern owner arrested.

**TL;DR:** gang gets get kidnapped by tavern owner, they escape through
the sewers, get revenge but don't murder the main suspects.

### Game 2: July 10th, 2015

| Video                                                                   |

Needing a place to stay the night, Tillian and Yofi stayed at the inn on
the other side of town, and Orso and Braggish (yes, the massive orc and
the brain dead gladiator) convinced a blind old woman named [Greta
Lief](/Greta_Lief "wikilink") to let them stay in her home. Long story
short, Braggish ended up making sweet Orcish love to Greta while Orso
was forced to listen.

After a small incident involving Yofi, fire, and curtains, the gang met
up in the market square of the town and met the mayor (deftly
pickpocketed by Tillian) who asked them to go on a simple quest: collect
some taxes from a local farmer named
[Brangus](/Farmer_Brangus "wikilink"). When they arrived at the farm,
they noticed the farmer was growing some very strange fruit. Braggish
ate one of the fruits and began drooling uncontrollably. The farmer
explained that they were called [Chomatos](/Chomatos "wikilink") and
that he created the fruit but hadn't found a good use for them. He asked
the group if they could possibly sell the fruit for him so he could pay
his taxes.

Orso got pissed off. He wanted to collect the damn taxes for the mayor,
not some weird ass fruit and attacked the farmer with his ballsack (a
hemp sack with a cannon ball inside of it). The farmer's dog, being
super protective, jumped in front of the hit and was torn in half by
Orso's ballsack. Tillian put Orso and the farmer to sleep while the rest
buried the dog. Eventually, they figured out trough trial and error that
the Chomatoes could be sold in town to cover the taxes (and make a
profit on top of that) and Braggish and Tillian went on their way while
Yofi and the [town's constable](/Godrick_Cooper "wikilink") (who showed
up) stayed behind to ensure that the farmer wasn't murdered by
bloodthirsty Orso.

[thumb|350px|center|Rough sketch of Orso killing the farmer's dog with
his ball sack, with Braggish vomiting in the foreground from the
chomatos.](/File:Orso_Killing_Dog.png "wikilink")

On the way to town, Braggish and Tillian came across the hanged body of
[Krom](/Krom "wikilink"), the half-orc who they let go the night before.
Krom had a strange [symbol](/Human_Trinity "wikilink") carved into his
forehead. They tried to get the body down carefully, but dropped it on
the ground, breaking Krom's legs and arms as it impacted. They went back
to the farm to show the body to the constable who wanted to see the
scene of the crime. This is where they discovered a small path leading
into the woods. They decided on the spot to come back to the farm later
and focus on the path for now since Braggish was pissed as hell that his
orc buddy was murdered.

After some travel, they ended up in a large forest clearing where a
bunch of folks were sitting around a camp fire. After sneaking around a
bit, the gang attacked. After several rounds of battle, all of the
people in the camp were dead except for one of them who had ran off into
the forest. In a large tent in the campsite, Yofi found nothing but a
single bottle of acid.

**TL;DR:** gang takes on a job collecting taxes, get sidetracked after
finding a murder victim, attacked a group of people around a campfire
who they suspect being the murderers.

### Game 3: July 17th, 2015

|                                                                         | Video |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| <embedvideo dimensions="200" service="youtube">gPQp-ee9g0E</embedvideo> |

They rested up and all of them slept except for Orso who wanted to try
out his new ability to illuminate his armor and boom his voice
incredibly loudly... all night. Amazingly, the night passed
uneventfully, but in the morning, some burly guys showed up and attacked
them. Also, Braggish recognized one of the guys as the guy who escaped
into the woods the night before. After some fighting, all of them were
defeated except for one who gave them some information about their
group.

The symbol carved into Krom's head was that of the [Human
Trinity](/Human_Trinity "wikilink"), a human supremacist group. On one
of the corpses, they found an encrypted message.

They asked their captive what the message meant, but he didn't know, so
they poured the bottle of acid out onto his head, which melted away like
a candle. Inside the bottle was a small capsule, which contained a small
strip of paper which contained the cypher required to decipher the
message. The message mentions bringing top recruits to a place called
"[Rayna's Castle](/Rayna's_Castle "wikilink")." The constable (who was
with them all this time) recognized the name, but only as "Rayna's
Ruins." He wondered if they were the same thing.

The group packs up, goes back to the farm, collect Krom's body, and head
back to Crow's Haven where they find Greta (the old woman who Braggish
fucked) hanged on the statue in the market-square.

Tillian and Yofi investigate the murder and eventually identify [Jimmy
Swinton](/Jimmy_Swinton "wikilink") as the murderer, who is the baker's
teenage son. Orso and Braggish hang out and take a nap in Greta's house,
AKA the murder scene. Jimmy Swinton says he's not going down alone and
implicates the constable's teenage niece, [Rose
Cooper](/Godrick_Cooper "wikilink"), as the one who helped him murder
Greta. Jimmy is locked up in jail, and the gang goes to sleep in Greta's
house.

**TL;DR:** gang find out who's responsible for Krom's murder, return to
town to find Greta murdered, but find the murderer who implicates a
relative of a friend. The gang sleeps in the murder victim's home.

### Game 4: July 31st, 2015

|                                                                         | Video |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| <embedvideo dimensions="200" service="youtube">FbFD1k4anGY</embedvideo> |

The gang is awoken by a loud banging on the door of Greta's house, and
it looks like most of the town is outside with torches and pitchforks,
ready to get rid of the group. They are pissed that they stayed in
Greta's home, only hours after she was murdered there and with her blood
still wet on the floor. They get chased out of town, and tell the
constable that they will meet up with him at his niece's cabin in the
woods. On the way out of town, they (accidentally) destroy the bridge
(the only way out of the town heading west), and leave a note behind
blaming the destruction on the Human Trinity.

They arrived at the cabin where Rose Cooper lives with her father,
[Derrick](/Godrick_Cooper "wikilink"). Without waiting for the
constable, they confront Rose and shit starts hitting the fan. The
constable eventually shows up and is confused by what's happening. By
this time, Rose has confessed after some interrogation tactics. Rose
doesn't seem too worried as she knows that her Human Trinity buddies are
outside, and they soon initiate an attack.

And again, after some fighting, the gang defeats the enemies and Rose
Cooper is brought to the town's jail by her uncle, the constable. In the
meantime, Orso finds a bottle of booze and passes out. When he comes to,
he finds another bottle, but can't read the label since he's illiterate
but drinks it anyway. This is a potion that causes intelligence to go
up, but it doesn't seem to do much either way.

While waiting for the constable to return, Braggish tans one of the
Human Trinity corpses in order to make Orso a coin purse made from a
human scrotum.

The constable returns and says that he needs to warn the [Brinnian
Guard](/Brinnian_Guard "wikilink") (army of the country) that there's a
massive threat by the Human Trinity before they head to Rayna's Castle.

**TL;DR:** gang is chased out of town for sleeping in Greta's house only
moments after her murder. They chase down Rose Cooper, but are ambushed
by the Human Trinity. Gang beats the HT and head towards a guard outpost
to warn them.

### Game 5: August 7th, 2015

|                                                                         | Video |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| <embedvideo dimensions="200" service="youtube">fYw0qu3zdOE</embedvideo> |

The gang sets out to warn the Brinnian Guard and head to the nearest
guard post. Upon getting there as soon as they mention the Human
Trinity, tensions begin to rise. Only two of the guards stationed at the
guard post don't attack them. One of them, mostly because he's a big fan
of Orso. After some fighting, again, they kill the enemies while one of
the friendly guards remains alive.

Looking though the guard captain's cabin, Yofi finds a bag of magical
beans. She knows what happens when you throw them (they explode) but
doesn't know what happens when you plant them. She decides to plant and
water the first, and a pink toad appears. As Tillian licks the toad to
get a high off it, though the toad becomes very large and just sits
there for a minute before disappearing in a cloud of pink smoke.

Yofi decides to plant another one, but this time, what comes out of the
earth is no toad. Instead a gargantuan hungry Bulette appears.

**TL;DR:** gang goes to Brinnian Guard, but it turns out they're
crooked. They fight and beat the crooked guards. Yofi summons a Bulette.

### Game 6: August 29, 2015

|                                                                         | Video |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| <embedvideo dimensions="200" service="youtube">kMk-BnpIRl8</embedvideo> |

Now, a Bulette is a large monstrosity with an average of 94 hit points
and very lethal attacks. The group rolled up backup characters before
this session and expected to die. I expected them all to die, especially
considering what happens next.

As the Bulette appears, it immediately kills Yofi, who drops her bag of
beans to the floor. Tillian, in his infinite wisdom, picks up the
remaining 8 beans, plants them, and pisses on them. Three more Bulettes
appear, a natural beer spring, a natural hot tea spring, a natural
vinegar spring, shriekers pop up everywhere, and another pink toad.

I thought this was it for the group. They were dead. But nope, I rolled
all of the Bulettes around 65-70 HP, which is lower than the average,
and the group killed ALL OF THEM. Although Tillian died for a bit. But
he came back, so that's good.

[thumb|200px|center|So yeah, four in total of these
guys.](/File:Bulette.jpg "wikilink")

Inside of one of the guards' footlockers Orso found a crudely drawn map
of the area, which he discarded, but Yofi picked up. The map shows a
path leading into the forest, Braggish is sure that the path will lead
them to the Human Trinity.

There was not much else to be found at the guard post, except for two
crusty socks that Orso found under the bed, which he believes are great
for fighting and magical (I still owe you the stats on that, Ren). Some
more Brinnian Guard showed up and asked them to help bury the bodies
after they were convinced that the gang wasn't responsible for the
massacre. They buried the bodies, rested up, and continued on the path.

**TL;DR:** more Bulettes are summoned and all eventually defeated. The
gang finds a map pointing them to Rayna's Castle and head in that
direction.

### Game 7: September 18, 2015

|                                                                         | Video |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| <embedvideo dimensions="200" service="youtube">8Jyy1Tx3KDE</embedvideo> |

After resting a night, they wake up in the morning an notice that Orso
is missing. They don't bother looking for him, assuming he'll show up
again at some point.

They travel the path for two days, and fight off various creatures and
bandits along the way. They also get confirmation that the way they're
traveling is towards Rayna's Castle. (or maybe this happened last
game...)

**Four Squirrels**

[Rockelby Thornweaver](/Rockelby_Thornweaver "wikilink") makes his first
appearance, but passes out in the grass for unknown reasons. The group
gets ta steppin' and leave him behind after a short rest, mistaking his
body for four squirrels. Yes, exactly four squirrels.

**Silent Night**

Travelling for another day, they make their final rest for the night,
but the sky is much darker than usual. Stars are not visible, there are
no noises, nothing is visible beyond the immediate surroundings of their
campfire, even those with darkvision have trouble seeing in this
darkness.

Tillian takes watch for the night while the rest of the group goes to
sleep. While taking a pee, he notices something strange with the trail.
Besides the footprints on the well-traveled part of the trail, he
notices faint footprints in the loose dirt around their campsite. They
don't look like their made by regular boots or shoes, and strangely look
like a solid print, no heel or toes. He wakes up Yofi, who goes and pees
nearby in her groggy state.

> "There's something strange going on. These footprints don't make any
> sense--", Tillian says.
> "I'm peeing, can you give me a second? Jesus\!" Yofi interrupts him
> very loudly.
> "Shut the fuck up, something's happening," Tillian hushes her under
> his breath, worried about their safety.

But it's too late. An arrow whistles through the air, striking Yofi, who
immediately feels unwell and realizes that the arrow that struck her was
poisoned. However, she manages to catch a glimpse of the archer hiding
in the thicket.

Braggish wakes up, but even though Yofi tells him where the archer is,
he's unable to see him. Yofi launches a fireball in the archer's
direction, which hits him, but barely. This allows Tillian to see the
archer at the rim of the fire, immediately casting Faerie Fire, which
outlines him for all to see him.

Upon seeing the archer, Braggish remembers all the tales of his hero
[Gruumsh](/Mhur "wikilink"), enters a rage and feels Gruumsh' Fury
course through his veins. He strikes the archer, slashing across his
chest with his greataxe and a second slash from bottom to top, through
the man parts. The archer, thinking to himself "man, I'm usually so
sneaky," dashes off so quickly that the group loses sight of him again
for a moment. However, seconds later, another arrow whistles though the
air which Tillian catches with his teeth, unaffected by the poison
(which he swallows).

Yofi finishes the archer with a barrage of Magic Missiles, which burst
the archer's body into chunks and mush. She inspects the body and
notices the [Human Trinity](/Human_Trinity "wikilink") symbol branded on
the remains of the archer's neck. Along his chest, there are many little
check-marks carved into his flesh, Yofi deduces that these are likely a
tally of his previous kills. They also deduce somehow that the guy's
name was Jonathan and that he wore soft baby footies.

Besides a very loud deer showing up, nothing happens for the remainder
of the night.

**A Fork in the Road**

They travel for another half day or so and come across a fork in the
road. The main path seems to continue towards the north over a hill, but
a thin trail goes off to the north-west. A few yards onto the thin
trail, they notice what looks like a scarecrow. Tillian comes closer,
and realizes it's not a scarecrow, but rather a Human Trinity soldier
wearing full military style armor crucified against a tree, also
sporting a Human Trinity symbol branded onto his neck. Yofi farts and
faints upon seeing the body. Carved into the soldier's throat in coarse
letters: "STAY OUT" followed by the Human Trinity symbol underneath.
Yofi wakes up and faints again.

Braggish climbs the tallest tree around to try and find out what lies at
the end of each path. He's able to see over the hill and about two miles
north he can see a massive open field with a castle in the middle of it.
The field is filled with people who are busy constructing things, but
he's not quite able to make out what they're constructing exactly. As he
looks northwest along the narrow trail, he can make out a small
makeshift cabin at the end of the trail, smoke is coming from its
chimney stack. He climbs down and tells Yofi and Tillian about what he
saw.

> "Castle up this way, hut over this way. We sneak to hut, kill
> everybody in hut. Too many people at castle," Braggish says.

But after thinking for a bit, he realizes that the dead guy is a warning
to the Human Trinity, and the hut may house a potential ally.

> "I still think we should sneak to the cabin."

Tillian inspects the body closer and wonders how the soldier was killed.
Even though there are carvings on his throat, they did not kill the man.
He can't detect on the surface what happened to him, there are no cuts,
not bruises, no breaks. Tillian gets very scared.

**The Hut**

[thumb|right|This, plus a pile of dead
bodies.](/File:Witch_Hut.jpg "wikilink")

The gang sneaks as stealthily as they can down the trail towards the
cabin. After half a mile or so, they come to the cabin that Braggish
spoke of. It looks makeshift, decrepit, and mostly improvised. It's a
miracle it's standing at all. Outside the hut is a pile of human
corpses, all carrying the Human Trinity brand on their necks, their
faces contorted in a mask of pain, and their chests cut open. Somebody
did not like these guys.

Tillian, in his infinite wisdom, grabs a piece of charcoal from his bag,
draws the Human Trinity symbol on his neck and charges into the cabin.
Inside, he sees the strangest collection of things he's ever seen.
Skulls, fingers in jars, eyeballs, a collection of small dead animals in
a bowl, all kinds of plants, and sitting at the end of the room against
the wall is an old woman. She is so old that her skin has become
translucent, he can see her insides throbbing underneath, her gray hair
is so long that it reaches the floor and she is so skinny that her limbs
resemble knobby twigs. Her white robes are tainted with rusty red
stains, and seem very well made. Her eyes are closed, but slowly open up
as he stands in front of her, there are no pupils, there is no iris,
they're just white.

Outside, Yofi has become scared since she senses that this place is
brimming with magic.

> "Ummm, there's a lot of magic here, guy," she tells Braggish. "I don't
> want to go over there. I'm scared."
> "Me think it's bad idea, too, but crazy man run in," he says.
> "We need to go get Tillian," she says not quite sure of herself.

They sneak over, but as they come closer, they feel a strange tingling
sensation. They hear, emanating from inside their minds, a voice that
sounds like a reverse whisper speaking words in an arcane language.
Within the blink of an eye, they're standing inside the cabin next to
Tillian. The doors have disappeared, the windows have shut.

In another act of defiance, Tillian pees on the floor and chants:
"Humans are great\! Humans are great\! Fuck you, you're like an ape."

Yofi senses something bad is about to happen, and warns the group.

> "I feel.. It's very evil vibes here, guys," she says.
> "That's why I'm peeing everywhere," Tillian explains.
> "I know you have a bladder problem, but.."
> "No. I have a bladder <em>gift</em>."
> "That's... a way of looking at it."
> "That's <em>the</em> way of looking at it."
> "There's evil here. <em>Evil.</em> We need to get out of here," she
> pleads.

The strange reverse whisper speaks an arcane word again in their minds,
and suddenly, she's standing in front of them.

> "What are you doing here?" the hag says.
> "Um, um," Yofi stutters.
> "Humans are great, bitch\!" Tillian exclaims.
> "Shut up, what are you doing?" Yofi yells at him.
> "We want to find killer of Human Trinity," Braggish says.

The hag's head angles itself towards Braggish, and instantly, Tillian
disappears from the room. He finds himself inside an enormously large
gray cube, but even though it's massive, Tillian hears his own breaths
echoing from the walls. There's nothing else there.

Meanwhile, the hag turns to Yofi.

> "What's your business here?" the hag asks of her. But Yofi only
> whimpers in fear, unsure of what to do.
> "We're coming to kill Human Trinity, they killed too many of friends,"
> Braggish says. "And we see you kill Human Trinity."
> The hag seems unfazed by Braggish' answer and asks Yofi again: "Why do
> you want to kill them?"
> "Oh God, just me? Um. I'm with him," she says and points at
> Braggish.
> "Why are you hear now?"
> "I'm with him," Yofi says again whimpering.
> "Why?" the hag asks again.
> "I'm with this group and our friends..."

When Yofi blinks her eyes, she's inside of a very large gray room. At
the end of the room she sees Tillian. She tries to run over to him, but
as she tries to run, it's as if she's running underwater and barely
moves. She tries to call out to him, but instead of noise, she sees her
voice's sound waves slowly emanate from her face and she eventually
catches up with them.

Braggish is now alone with the hag, she's looking straight at him and
Braggish feels the rest of the world slip away into nothingness. And
there's only Braggish and the old hag. Braggish knows he's the only hope
left, he knows he needs to convince her and stop wasting her time.

> "We were taken to be eaten in Crow's Haven," Braggish says. "That's
> how we together. Then I make wonderful love with Greta and she was
> killed by Human Trinity for her love for me. And we have friend who
> was killed so we come on mission to kill Human Trinity at Rayna's
> Castle."
> "What do you want to do," the hag asks of him.
> "I want to find leader of Human Trinity and get revenge for Greta. And
> kill him... her... whoever... it."

Braggish finds himself in a total void. There's nothing surrounding him
but the presence of the hag. Three items form in between the hag and the
hag. A sword, a very large book, and a tiny vial.

> "Your friends, do you want them back?" She asks of Braggish.
> "Yes. I cannot face all the Human Trinity alone."
> "If you want them back, swear to destroy the Human Trinity for me and
> come back to me when you're done."
> "I swear upon Gruumsh, on one eye-"

As he's saying this, a needle slowly protrudes from between her eyes and
moves in between Braggish' eyes. Both their blood slowly starts dripping
down the needle until it meets in the middle, drips down, and forms a
small statue.

> "I will keep this and I will keep your promise," the hag says.

Next thing he knows, Braggish is standing outside a the clearing, Human
Trinity bodies all around, Tillian and Yofi laying motionless on the
floor. The hut is gone, not a trace of it around. But there's a sword,
there's a book, and there's a small vial in front of him on the floor
and he's got one hell of a headache. Braggish touches his forehead, sees
blood on his fingers, and realizes that what happened was real. He is
also suddenly profoundly aware that the castle is indeed Rayna's Castle
and that there's one safe way into the castle. He doesn't know right now
what it is, but once he'll see it, he will know it.

Braggish wakes Yofi and Tillian and tells them what happened.

Braggish picks up the sword, [a
greatsword](/Anyar's_Greatsword "wikilink"), and feels as though he has
had the sword his whole life, it feels as though it's a part of him, and
he knows he will do whatever it takes to keep this sword since the
thought of losing it destroys him inside.

Yofi also has an [attraction to the book](/Anyar's_Tome "wikilink") and
opens it. She doesn't understand what the book is exactly - though she
knows it's not part of this world - but she knows for sure that whatever
it contains will greatly help her improve her magic skills.

Tillian also has a strange [attraction to the
vial](/Anyar's_Vial_of_Resurrection "wikilink"), even more so than the
thought of all the gold in the world. He looks at the vial and notices
the glass is faceted. Inside the facets, he sees the faces of the people
he's lost, people who are dear to him. Just holding the vial has a
profound impact on him, it's something very special and he knows there's
a slight magical power to the vial. He shows Yofi the vial, and she
identifies it as a vial of resurrection. Her mentor has warned her
against this type of magic.

As Tillian looks around, he notices that the colors of the leaves have
changed to brown, they all have a strange feeling that much time has
passed. Yofi notices a distinct lack of magic in the area, but a strange
unknown type of magic coming from their new items. It doesn't feel good,
but not quite evil. Braggish feels burdened by his new contract with the
hag.

Night falls, and they set up camp where the hut once stood.

**TL;DR:** after days of travel and fighting, they come to the end of
the path, which forks towards a cabin and Rayna's Castle in the other
direction. They head towards the cabin where they meet a hag who gives
them magical items. However, once back out, much time seems to have
passed.

Sorry for the mixed present- and past-tense of this recap\!

Straggo and Rockelby have been making their way towards [Rayna's
Castle](/Rayna's_Castle "wikilink") for the last couple of days along a
road leading north. Last night, however, they were awoken by approaching
footsteps. They quickly extinguished their campfire and hid in the
thicket. A group of eight [Human Trinity](/Human_Trinity "wikilink")
soldiers escorting a half-elf ranger walks by and don't seem to notice
them.

Yofi, Braggish, and Tillian spend the night at the site where the hag's
cabin once stood. In the morning, they set out back to the main path
with intentions of heading back to the castle.

On this path, the badass half-elf ranger Olwyn is being escorted by her
eight Human Trinity captors towards [Rayna's
Castle](/Rayna's_Castle "wikilink"). However, once they get to a small
logging camp at a bend in the road, a scout moves ahead quickly towards
a tree with an elf corpse crucified on it. He cuts down the corpse and
calls out to his compatriots that there's now space on the tree for her.

At this point, Braggish, Yofi, and Tillian arrive at the point where the
trail they're on connects with the main path. It looks much different
than what seems only moments ago since the road is now paved over and
most of the trees have been cut. In the distance, they notice a half-elf
being held prisoner. They quickly realize that she's about to be
crucified by them against this tree; Braggish triggers.

He attacks the Human Trinity soldiers and jumps out the thicket. Straggo
and Rockelby see an enormous enraged orc slashing into the Human Trinity
soldiers and decide to help him out. With everyone pitching in, it's not
long before the soldiers are defeated and the prisoner freed.

After some introduction and deliberation, they realize that they all
have a common goal in defeating the Human Trinity (or at least getting
revenge), and decide to head out to Rayna's Castle together (Braggish,
Yofi, Tillian, Straggo, Rockelby, and Olwyn). Rockelby scouts ahead and
notices an army camped outside of the castle, docks near the castle, a
road leading into the castle from the west, and a windmill about 2 miles
from the castle. Once he relays this information to the group, Braggish
realizes (with a little help from his soulbind with the hag) that the
windmill is the way into the castle somehow, but he doesn't know exactly
how.

They decide to wait for nightfall, and once the skies are pitch black,
they set out for the windmill. The field outside the castle is lit by
hundreds - if not thousands - of pinpoints of light. However, there's
only a single campfire at the windmill. Once they approach, Straggo
attempts to deceive the soldiers there by impersonating a Human Trinity
solider named "Carl" by wearing the armor of one of the slain soldiers.
It does not seem to go well as one of the scouts halts him. Straggo
therefore attacks the soldiers stationed at the windmill, delivering a
massive blow to them; instantly incinerating one of them using his
Fireball spell. The scout in the windmill shot up an arrow which
exploded like a flare, an obvious signal to the rest of the soldiers on
the field. It didn't take long for the group to take out the rest of the
soldiers stationed at the windmill.

As Braggish approaches, he notices a capped well near the site and
another hag-induced realization tells him that this is the way to the
castle. The well is capped with the the old windmill's millstone, but
Braggish is able to push the cap off in a single push. He lowers Yofi
down the well, who informs the group that there's a single pipe leading
off into the distance -- in the direction of the castle.

Meanwhile, Olwyn searches the windmill and discovers that the
cornerstone of the windmill has a sigil carved into it; it reads
"Dourblood". She hears some scurrying in the corner and realizes that
she's not alone in the windmill. She calls out, but there is no answer.
However, she can see two glistening eyes in the darkness peering at her.
She calls out for someone to help her and Tillian shows up. Seeing that
they are not humans, a goblin named Grims (Grimsy to friends) wearing
nothing but tattered clothing appears from the corner. He asks if they
have seen his family, but Olwyn tells him that she has not seen any
goblins around. They go outside and find a pile of ashes from burnt
goblin bodies, which deeply affects Grimsy. He is sure that it's his
family, but also notes that it's not everyone. He searches the soldiers'
bodies and finds a dagger covered in goblin blood. Tillian searches the
tent nearby, in which he finds a necklace of goblin teeth and a jar
filled with goblin teeth.

Grimsy notices that not too far away, a large group of Human Trinity
soldiers is heading their way, no doubt alarmed by the flare shot up by
the scout. The gang hurries down the well and Straggo collapses the well
behind them using his Mold Earth cantrip. They continue down the pipe
that Yofi noticed for a good fifteen minutes. The water turns more
viscous and the smell of sewage permeates the air. Rockelby notices that
his torch seems to burn brighter and the flame turns greenish. Fearing
that something may happen, he extinguishes his torch and rides Olwyn's
wolf for the remainder since he can't see anything.

After a while, they come upon a junction where two large sewer pipes
(raised about 15 feet) lead into a small basin, slowly pumping out a
mixture of piss and shit. The center of the basin seems dark and deep,
so they walk along the sides of it, forcing Grimsy to take the lead
(Tillian jiggling the jar of goblin teeth). Braggish follows him and
throws him up into one of the pipes. Yofi follows Braggish and jumps on
his back, but disturbing the water's surface wakes up something that
lives in these sewers.

A massive black globular creature lashes out to Braggish and a fight
ensues. Olwyn shoots several arrows at the creature, but as her arrows
hit, they dissolve in its mass. Braggish hits the creature with his
greatsword, but it splits the creature in half. Eventually, on of the
halves dies and Yofi decides to kill it off with a firebolt. As she sets
off the firebolt, the gasses in the tunnels ignite, burning everyone
around. Eventuall, the black glob is defeated and on its body they find
a pair of golden glasses with broken lenses and a silvered dagger
inscribed "Juliana."

They decide to explore the pipes by letting Grimsy go down the one on
the left and Yofi down the one on the right. After fifteen minutes,
Grimsy comes to the end of the pipe which leads underneath a manhole
through which he overhears a conversation between two soldiers bitching
about their leader named LeDouch√©. Yofi also travels for fifteen minutes
and comes into a large room where the sewers lead off into a deep fall,
which is grated off. A few soldiers are present in this room, but they
don't seem to be paying attention to anything other than their card
game.

Both Yofi and Grimsy head back and inform the others of what they saw.
The gang decides to go down the pipe that Yofi explored since Grimsy
said that the manhole is too far up to climb up. Straggo doesn't trust
him and confirms this for himself by heading down the pipe himself. The
gang travels down the other pipe and in the distance they can see some
light where the pipe opens up into a
room...

#### Sewer Room

Getting close to the room, Tillian notices four guards (not soldiers)
sitting at a table playing cards. The river of sewage flows through this
room to a massive sewer grate on the other side. There's one way out of
the room, a door on the left side, but they won't be able to get there
without giving away their position. Tillian says to the group "if you
guys don't object, I'm gonna put these guys to sleep." He casts
thaumaturgy in the river of shit and makes the shit rumble and bubble.
All the guards come over except for one, intrigued by the weird behavior
of the shit. As they stand over the shit, staring at it, Tillian casts
thaumaturgy once more and makes the it grunt out "shit." Entranced by
the shit, Tillian casts Sleep, making two of the guards fall face first
into the river of filth. The other two guards realize that something is
very wrong here and are on high alert, looking around for anything
suspicious. Thankfully, due to the darkness of the sewer pipe they're in
and the lack of darkvision of the human guards, they are still hidden,
but one of the remaining guards is focused on the pipe while the other
pulls his buddy from the sewage.

Olwyn takes aim with her longbow, and shoots first, hitting the guard
looking down the sewer pipe, striking him in the neck, he gurgles blood,
but doesn't go down. The other guard freaks out at this sight and is
caught by one of Rockelby's arrows in the chest, heaving blood. At this
point, a guard enters the door (apparently naked except for a tool
belt), holding a platter with five beers on it. As he sees his buddies
getting slaughtered he drops the beers and locks the door behind him.
Tillian quickly casts Sleep again, and the new guard tumbles into the
sewage as well. The three guards who fell into the sewage are now
bundling up at the sewer grate, still asleep.

Again, Olwyn takes aim with her longbow and shoots the sleeping naked
guard, grazing his face, and he wakes up screaming in pain. Yofi casts
Firebolt on the same guard, scorching him of all his body hair, his
nipples melt off, right before he explodes into a million bits, causing
his tool belt to fly into the air, landing in the sewage. The explosion
wakes up the sleeping guards. Yofi dives after the toolbelt after
noticing that it holds a keychain. Rockelby shoots the same guard he
shot before, this time striking his neck, cutting off his head. The
pieces of his body also fall forward into the stream of sewage. Straggo
tears into one of the remaining guards with a tentacle attack, ripping
his skin to shreds and knocking him prone.

One of the remaining guards runs towards Olwyn, slicing her twice with
his short sword. She tries to hit back but fails and whiffs the air. The
other guard who fell prone stands up and attacks Yofi who is currently
underwater looking for the tool belt, stabbing her twice with his short
sword.

Upon seeing this, Tillian yells out an insult to this guard so harsh
("Hey, shit dick\!") that he feels so ashamed that he drowns himself in
the sewage. Braggish roars and comes barreling down to a guard and
murders him, and from where he stands, he throws his sword at the last
guard which impales and kills him. The sword falls down the sewer grate
and Braggish yells out "come back to me, sword\!" And [miraculously, the
sword reappears in his hand](/Anyar's_Greatsword "wikilink").

With the last guard dead, Braggish wonders what's in the large box in
this room. He rips open the box and notices that it's filled with all
kinds of civilians' clothing for all ages and races -- except for
humans. Braggish throws the clothing into the sewer.

Yofi, diving up from the sewage, holds the tool belt in her hand, poo
dripping from her face. She inspects the tool belt and on the inside of
the leather there's a name inscribed: "[T.
Allen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQwYNca4iog)" Braggish tries the
door, he jiggles the handle and it's locked. Yofi puts her ear against
the door to make sure that at least it sounds safe enough to open, hears
nothing, looks through the keyhole and sees a pile of clothes on a
stairs, but nothing else. She quietly opens the door into a staircase
leading up.

But before heading up, they decide to take a short rest to tend to their
wounds and regain their spell slots. Rockelby takes the time to use mage
hand to *help* himself. While this happens, Braggish stands guard
outside the door, and distinguishes the torches in the stairwell so he
won't be seen. For the first half of the hour, nothing happens, but
about 30 minutes in, he hears a large crowd in the distance murmuring.

#### Jonathan LeDouch√©

Braggish walks up the stairs first and he sees a long hallway, a door to
another room is on the right wall of this hallway, and even further down
the hallway, it turns off to the right where the crowd noise seems to be
coming from. On the walls are tattered paintings with humans on them,
dead plants adorn the hallway; the place looks neglected. Yofi
recognizes one of the figures in a painting of a stately family portrait
as a younger version of the hag they encountered in the forest hut
earlier. Another painting depicts the lady's husband on horseback in
battle, but the painting is defaced with a massive slash through it.

An earthenware goblet comes flying out the room to the right and smashes
in the wall across. "How many times do I have to tell you to serve my
ale in a copper goblet," an irritated voice yells out. "I'm sorry, sir.
I'll fetch your goblet," another voice says and they can hear a door
opening and closing. "I never had this problem when I was a
witch-hunter," the irritated voice yells out again. "God, it's so hard
to find good help these days\!"

Rockelby sneaks up to the entrance to this room, unseen. He sees a small
office with a desk, behind it a well-groomed blond gentleman in a Human
Trinity officer's outfit carrying two light crossbows on both hips and a
short sword on his back, drinking from a copper goblet, he looks
irritated. Inside the room, he sees a bookcase, and to the left, there's
a door. The man in the office seems to be looking through paperwork
while he's drinking his ale. Rockelby sneaks back and tells them about
everything he saw, he suggests sneaking there and jump him. Yofi says to
put a knife to his throat and intimidate him. Tillian says "I'm gonna
put that bitch to sleep and no one's gonna stop me" and walks over. He
casts his spell by banging his drum loudly from the doorway, but it has
no effect.

Braggish upon noticing this, runs up into the office past Tillian, up to
the HT officer and says "put down your weapon or you'll die." The
officer is not impressed by Braggish. Braggish attempts to stab him and
misses entirely and feels discouraged and disgraced. Rockelby sees
Braggish run down the hallway and runs after him. When he gets to the
room, he sees Braggish fail dramatically. He takes a shot at the HT
officer and hits him in the arm to little effect.

The officer takes out both of his light crossbows, aims the first one at
Tillian and says "*Ruby*, do your thing\!" He shoots Tillian in the
face, doing much damage. He aims his second crossbow at Braggish, gives
it a little kiss for good luck, and says "*Argos*, do it\!" But the
weapon malfunctions and cracks into the wood of the crossbow, damaging
it. "Argos, nooo\! What are YOU DOING\!" Regardless, he stays in the
same spot and doesn't move. He puts his hands on his hips confidently,
possibly overly confident, and slightly femininely (Tre: "he's got them
birthing hips"). "Come get this\!" he yells.

Straggo moves up and casts a hex on him, then shoots him with two
eldritch bolts of which one hits and slams him into the wall behind him.
Yofi runs into the office, grabs his face, and with a surprising amount
of hatred in her eyes, screams "*I hate your face\!*" A lightning bolt
materializes in the room from the ceiling, strikes his face, sets his
hair on fire, then burns his face straight off in a flash of electric
light. He hangs by the thinnest thread.

Intending to kill him with a dick-slap, Tillian walks up to him, with
his 1" long erect micro penis (roll me a D20 to see how many inches your
dick is -- crit fail) but is unable to reach his face and misses
completely. The HT officer seems scared, he's never seen anything like
it before, but feels better with his own manhood and heals slightly.

Having made much noise during battle, they hear a rustling in the
adjacent room and muffled speech. Braggish' sword stabs him in his face,
the sword pierces his skull and impacts the wall behind him. As his body
weight falls onto the blade, it gets sliced in half and his body falls
onto the floor.
