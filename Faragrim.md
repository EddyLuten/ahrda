## **Background**

[right|thumb|250px|Artist: Marc Lee](/File:Faragrim.jpg "wikilink")

Mithral Hall, a dwarven stronghold located in the northern region of
Faerun, has a long history of tragedy and triumph. Centuries ago it was
invaded by a shadow dragon named Shimmergloom and an army of Duergar,
which not only drove the Dwarves from their home but also reduced its
population from the thousands to mere hundreds. The dwarves would
eventually reclaim their home 300 years later, but it wouldn't be too
long before they faced another invasion. Within the century Mithral Hall
would fall under attack from an army of Drow and fiends from the
Underdark, then twice from an army comprised of Orcs, Goblins, and
Trolls not too long after. Though weakened by each attack, the dwarves
slowly persevered by forging alliances with local townsfolk, barbarian
tribes, and the Svirfneblin.

Faragrim was among the 200 Dwarf guards stationed at Settlestone, a
small settlement outside of Mithral Hall that functions as a forward
base and trade city for the dwarven stronghold. There, his primary
duties as one of the army's divine healers were to tend to the sick and
wounded, which he considered an incredibly tedious task; he would rather
be among those charged with more exciting duties like patrolling the
perimeter, keeping the area clear of monsters and beasts, or escorting
supply wagons. Having grown weary of his mundane life, he began praying
to the Morndinsamman for more eventful days and an adventurous life.
Much to his suprise, the gods granted his wish; within a week's time he
was given orders to seek out new allies for Mithral Hall, as well as
magical items that will aid in its protection. His journey would lead
him to Neverwinter, where his adventure begins.

## **Description**

Faragrim is short by even dwarven standards, standing stout at 3'11" and
weighing about 200lbs. He has a slightly tanned complexion, a bald head,
and proudly sports long, braided facial hair of a light brownish hue.
His 200 years of age is beginning to show in the few graying strands in
his beard.

He wears a set of simple robes or sometimes a hooded cloak over his
dwarven armor, which conceals a torso covered in several tattoos of holy
symbols representing each member of the Morndinsamman. He also wears a
pendant bearing the symbol of the All-Father, Moradin.

Faragrim is a capable fighter and proficient with traditional dwarven
weapons, though favors the Warhammer. Having spent the majority of his
military service as a field medic, he relishes in every opportunity to
test himself in combat and loathes performing healing magic but obliges
reluctantly to appease his deities.
