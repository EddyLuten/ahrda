## Creation

Though there are many creation stories, most of them at least agree that
Ahrda was created by Melora, the goddess of wilderness and the sea. What
happened after the creation event and what the reason was for its
creation differs greatly from one belief to another. The exact details
were lost to the passing of time and are likely never to be recovered.
Some say Melora created the world out of boredom, some say that she
needed subjects to rule, and some even say that there was no reason for
it whatsoever.

## Geographical Overview

The world of Ahrda consists of a single continent bound by an ocean
named [Melora's Grasp](/Melora's_Grasp.md "wikilink"). It theoretically
possible to travel by land from the eastern tip of the world to the
western tip, though the task would be nearly impossible.

### Merion Region

To the west lies the Merion region, home and birthplace of The region is named after
[Merion](Regions/Merion.md "wikilink"), the oldest human territory. The Merion
region consists of [Merion](Regions/Merion.md "wikilink"),
[Esparva](Regions/Esparva.md "wikilink"), [Falios](Regions/Falios.md "wikilink"),
[Rhos](Regions/Rhos.md "wikilink"), [Brinnar](Regions/Brinnar.md "wikilink"), and
[Takrios](Regions/Takrios.md "wikilink"), all occupied by humans, although with
very different cultures. Some count [Ishaara](Regions/Ishaara.md "wikilink") as
part of this region as well, though Ishaarans are quick to denounce this
assumption and don't consider themselves part of any region.

### Krinland Region

The vast Krinland region covers the north, consisting of
[Krinland](Regions/Krinland.md "wikilink"), [Borval](Regions/Borval.md "wikilink"), and
[Heelkoud](Regions/Heelkoud.md "wikilink"). These territories consist extreme
climates ranging from scorching deserts in eastern Krinland to icy
plains in Borval and Heelkoud. This region is heavily mined by Dwarves
for its minerals and metals.

### Brend Region

At the heart of the world lies the Dwarven home of
[Brend](RegionsBrend/Brend.md "wikilink") centered around the [Moradin's
Fist](Regions/Brend/Moradin's_Fist.md "wikilink") mountain. All of the Dwarves' mining
production eventually makes its way to Brend. The
[Deirstahl](Regions/Deirstahl.md "wikilink") territory is considered to be part of
Brend and is used by the dwarves to trade with the human Merion region
as well as the crumbling Sivor Empire.

### Blackfire Region

The [Blackfire Expanse](Regions/Blackfire_Expanse.md "wikilink") makes up most of
the north-east, with [Verweg](Regions/Verweg.md "wikilink") making up the
remainder. While Verweg is the quiet and almost hermit-like home of the
Dragonborn, the Blackfire Expanse is home to an empire driven to
religious conquest. Parts of Milondra, Avria, and Briella have been
conquered by the Blackfire Empire.

### Elvish Region

Elves live east of Brend in a complicated social balance in the regions
of [X'usmed](Regions/X'usmed.md "wikilink"), [Dau'riel](Regions/Dau'riel.md "wikilink"),
[Briella](Regions/Briella.md "wikilink"), and [Avria](Regions/Avria.md "wikilink"). All but
X'usmed are regions isolated to one particular group of Elves. Dau'riel
is home of the high elves, Briella is home of the Drow, and Avria is
home of the Wood Elves.


### Wilderness

To the south-east lies an [untamed
wilderness](Regions/Untamed_Wilderness.md "wikilink"). Although some settlements
can be found here, this area hosts climates and ecosystems unwelcoming
to many of the humanoid creatures of Ahrda.

[Milondria](/Milondria "wikilink") lies to the far east of Ahrda and is
not considered to be part of any particular region due to the outlaw
nature of its inhabitants. Many of the world's unwanted social elements
tend to end up here, and Milondria is happy to host them.

### Southern Region

Finally, to the south are the remnants of the once great [Sivor Empire](Regions/Sivor_Empire.md "wikilink"), bordered by
[Gerbilor](Regions/Gerbilor.md "wikilink"), home of Gnomes, and
[Mhur](Regions/Mhur.d "wikilink"), home of Orcs. The Sivor Empire has lost its
grasp of much of the territory it once claimed due to the incompetency
of its leadership, but its neighboring countries fear one last desperate
grasp for territory.
