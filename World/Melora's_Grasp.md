Melora's Grasp is the only ocean on [Ahrda](Ahrda.md), encompassing the entire world, approximately 46.5% of Ahrda's surface
area (not including seas and bays).

Much of Melora's Grasp is still unexplored due to the supercontinental
nature of Ahrda's landmasses. Civilizations are able to create trade
routes over land or relatively calm seas without having to risk the
rough waters of Melora's Grasp.
