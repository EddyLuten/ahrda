*"Only fools would attempt a raid on Blackfog; while it appears to be a
small town of defenseless merchants, in reality it's a community of
highly-skilled assassins and hardened criminals.‚Äù*

## **Overview**

Blackfog is a trade area located in the northernmost region of
[Milondria](/Milondria "wikilink").

Due to the generally lawless nature of the country, Blackfog serves as
one of the few establishments that cater to Ahrda's unwanted social
elements. Here, criminals are provided with sanctuary; and those who
have reformed have the opportunity to build a new life for themselves
and contribute to the community as merchants and craftsmen. Without the
presence of constables or military, the general populace regulate the
peace by enforcing a very strict, but simple, code of conduct:

"Get along, or get out."
