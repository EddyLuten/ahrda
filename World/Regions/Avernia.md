Tiefling Homeland
Used to be humans, turned tiefling due to a deal struck with Asmodeus to 
grant them the strength to ward off the Drow during the Elven Civil War.

After the war was over there was a month long celebration, when the party
was over, they realized they had all changed physically. Now the whole country
is a mecca for indulgences, from drug and drink to brothels and bread.

Relatively safe unless you're trying to screw over established businesses. Tourism
is a major source of income, so people need to feel safe to keep bringing their money.
