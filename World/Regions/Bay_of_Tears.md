Whether it be tears of sorrow or tears of joy, the Bay of Tears
continues to deliver on its name. [Esparva](/Esparva "wikilink"),
[Rhos](/Rhos "wikilink"), [Brinnar](/Brinnar "wikilink"),
[Takrios](/Takrios "wikilink"), [Merion](/Merion "wikilink"), and to a
certain extent [Falios](/Falios "wikilink") all conduct their sea-bound
trade through this region. Large sprawling port cities adorn the shores
of the bay, acting as nerve centers for trade and commerce in the
region.

This much money and goods passing through the region attracts the
inevitable predators, and the Bay of Tears is home to many pirates.
[Piracy](/Piracy "wikilink"), in fact, has become such a large industry
on its own that several previously uninhabited islands are now home to
ad-hoc pirate cities, ruled by ruthless and lawless bandits.

Recently, pirates have made an entry into the world of trafficking
people - mostly the crew of the captured ships - which are then sold to
the highest bidder on pirate city black markets.

All of the countries in the region (with the notable exception of
Takrios) has a naval force in place to protect its trade routes from
pirates.
