Ruled by a king and queen who care little for tradition and rather see
their subjects happy to follow their own desires. Because of this, Rhos
can appear to outsiders a bit chaotic and sometimes lawless, but there's
a surprising lack of crime and mostly happy inhabitants. High taxes pay
for such public amenities as public wells, homeless shelters,
gladiatorial arenas, aqueducts, and a large standing army. Rhos attracts
many foreigners due to the beautiful seaside and its relaxed laws, and
is densely populated due to the lack of land.
