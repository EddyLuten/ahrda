What Braggish sees from the tree:

  - The Windmill (see below)
  - The castle has grown to be much larger, new construction visible
  - An army encampment outside the castle
  - A road leading into the castle
  - A newly dug canal leading from east to west
  - A dock with several ships moored adjacent to the castle

After purveying the sprawling field the castle is situated on, Braggish
notices a windmill in the distance. He knows that it's related to the
castle entrance, but can't explain why.

There's a small group of Human Trinity soldiers there, which they will
have to kill. There's a stone well near the windmill, which has been
capped off with a millstone. Once they remove the millstone, they
discover the well is dry and leads into the sewers. Braggish will
confirm that this is the way to go.

This well is close enough to the castle for them to be seen, so they
best do it at
night.
