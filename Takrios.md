Human territory on [Ahrda](/Ahrda "wikilink").

**Inhabitants:** Humans

**Climate:** cold, dry winters, and mild, dry summers.

Takrios started off as a calm region of mostly sheep herders living in
mountainous regions, but through the proliferation of the religion
worshiping Tempus, it has become more aggressive over the years both
outwards as well as inwards towards its own citizens. Executions due to
heresy are a common occurrence these days. Missionaries from Takrios,
spreading the word of Tempus, have been seen as far as the [Brinnian
Isle](/Brinnian_Isle "wikilink").
