Human territory on [Ahrda](/Ahrda "wikilink").

**Inhabitants:** Humans

**Climate:** warm, mostly dry winters, and hot, dry summers

Cradle of human civilization, Merion is the namesake of the region and
served as template to newer societies such as
[Falios](/Falios "wikilink"). Mathematics, science, and the arts all
originate in Merion, where the brightest minds in the region still favor
to spend their lives. Slowly, its border with
[Takrios](/Takrios "wikilink") is shrinking due to Takrios claiming more
and more territory. Having no army to speak of, Merion can do little to
prevent this. Many believe that a war (though short-lived it may be in
favor of the Takrians) between Takrios and the rest of the region is
inevitable.
