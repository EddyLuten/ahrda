Drow territory on [Ahrda](/Ahrda "wikilink").

**Inhabitants:** Exclusively Drow (Dark Elves)

**Climate:** cold summers and winters

Territory inhabited by Drow after being banished from
[Dau'riel](/Dau'riel "wikilink"), [Avria](/Avria "wikilink") and
[X'usmed](/X'usmed "wikilink") after the [Elven Civil
War](/Elven_Civil_War "wikilink") where great genocidal atrocities were
committed by the Drow. The skies above Briella have been artificially
darkened by magic to allow the Drow to dwell on the surface. Because of
the lack of light, there is a distinct lack of nature and wildlife.
There are large forests of dead trees inhabited by creatures normally
dwelling the [Underdark](/Underdark "wikilink").
