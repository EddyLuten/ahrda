Human territory on [Ahrda](/Ahrda "wikilink").

**Inhabitants:** Humans

**Climate:** temperate

The second oldest territory in the [Merion
Region](/:Category:Merion_Region "wikilink") (after
[Merion](/Merion "wikilink") itself) ruled by a long line of kings from
the same, ancient, family. The first group of settlers to depart from
the country of Merion settled in this region due to its great conditions
for farming. Over the millennia, Brinnar grew to include the region now
known as [Falios](/Falios "wikilink") and eventually the [Brinnian
Isle](/Brinnian_Isle "wikilink"). The then-province of Falios eventually
gained its independence from Brinnar three-hundred years ago through a
[long and bloody war](/War_for_Freedom "wikilink") that left both
countries hostile towards each other ever since. Though prosperous
within the Merion Region, its inhabitants are a rough crowd that mostly
focus on their own lives and little on the happiness of others.
