Passage of time on [Ahrda](/Ahrda "wikilink") is measured in
one-thousand year periods called "Ages of Melora," of which we're
currently (time-synced to Earth time) in the Seventh Age of Melora. Like
clockwork, each Age of Melora gives way to a major world event, usually
on the final day of the age, which is referred to as the [Day of
Ages](/Day_of_Ages "wikilink"). The previous ages are listed below with
their consecutive world years:

## Ages of Melora

**First Age of Melora** (years 1 through 999) - Creation: the creation
of the world and its people, and subsequent [creation
myths](/Creation_Myths "wikilink") all happened during this age.
According to lore, it took Melora exactly one thousand years to complete
the creation of Ahrda. The world was completed on what was to be called
the [Day of Ages](/Day_of_Ages "wikilink").

*First Day of Ages*

**Second Age of Melora** (years 1000 through - 1999) - Civilization:
Melora, upon seeing that the creatures she created began dividing the
world in regions, countries, and settlements, regretted her decision of
creating Ahrda and began destroying it. The other deities interfered and
after a long and bloody battle, Erathis, goddess of Civilization,
convinced Melora to cease her destruction on the Day of Ages. However,
during the course of the battle, an entire inhabited landmass named
[Traia](/Traia "wikilink") was sunken by Melora to the bottom of
Melora's Grasp.

*Second Day of Ages*

**Third Age of Melora** (years 2000 through 2999) - Darkness: While
Melora agreed to cease her destruction of the world, she continued
sending her wrath into the world for the remainder of this age. She
granted creatures such as demons, illithids, and undead the ability to
roam the surface where they thrived for a thousand years until Melora
abandoned Ahrda on the Day of Ages and left the world for what it was.
Several powerful deities came together and banished most of the evil
creatures to dwell in places of darkness where they still remain.

*Third Day of Ages*

**Fourth Age of Melora** (years 3000 through 3999) - Healing: The
previous two ages were brutal for the people of Ahrda, and with Melora
finally out of the picture, civilization could start anew. For a
thousand years populations regrew, suffering was a thing of the past,
the world healed, and Melora was forgotten. During this age, many of the
large cities that are still around today were established and
civilization flourished like never before. On the Day of Ages of the
Fourth Age of Melora, an ancient goddess took physical form in the elven
kingdom of Ga'va.

*Fourth Day of Ages*

**Fifth Age of Melora** (years 4000 through 4999) - War: see [Elven
Civil War](/Elven_Civil_War "wikilink"). Seemingly nothing happened on
the Day of Ages for this period, yet something evil spawned in the
depths of the underdark.

*Fifth Day of Ages*

**Sixth Age of Melora** (years 5000 through 5999) - Fire: see [Ascension
of D'arr](/Ascension_of_D'arr "wikilink").

*Sixth Day of Ages*

**Seventh Age of Melora** (years 6000 - present) - All current campaigns
are during this age. No day of ages has occurred yet.
