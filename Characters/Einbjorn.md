Einbjorn
Bugbearian [Man vs. Owlbear](../Campaigns/Man_vs_Owlbear/Man_vs_Owlbear.md)


## **Appearance**
Einbjorn is 7ft tall and his thick coat of course brown fur makes is already massive frame even more imposing. 
His body is topped with an utterly huge golinoid head, large pointy ears, sharp teet with fangs protruding from his lower lips.

Currently his coat is matted with mud, sparse amounts of blood and other grime that has settled in over time, only covered with scraps of the clothing he had when he was captured

## **Personality**
 I've mostly been forced to adopt a "shoot first, ask questions later" outlook.  Before then I was perfectly friendly, but generally on the quiet side. 

## **Background**
I'm from a tiny isolated village named Norheim in the North Eastern corner of Brend, deep within the Forngard Forest. My clan found me as a tiny cub alone in the forest. They took me in and raised me as one of their own; teaching me right from wrong and how to fight and survive in the rough wilderness. My people are expert hunters, but our methods would be considered strange and barbaric by most people. Instead of using a bow, we would instead sneak up on our prey and kill them using a swift swing of an axe. While unorthodox, it was certainly effective. I was always the best at sneaking up on an animal. The elders said it was in my blood. Literally, something about bugbear make them excellent at sneaking. I think it's our furry feet.

Being as isolated as we were, Norheim never had many visitors. A random wandering druid or ranger would come across us by accident, but they rarely returned. The exception to this was an old dwarf trader named Rangrim. He had been trading with my tribe for generations. He would provide various things we couldn't find or make ourselves in exchange for our hides and pelts. He loved our hides. Since we didn't use arrows that would leave ugly holes in the skin, the pelts we traded were always beautiful. Rangrim was pretty scared of me when we first met, but eventually we became friends. He was the one that taught me how to play cards. He always found it funny how small the cards looked in my hands. He said that I had a knack for it and that I'd make a killing if I ever made it to the big city. I never really understood what he meant, but I'd like to find out someday.

As a rule, no one from the village would venture beyond the edge of the forest. That is except for those chosen to participate in Langr Asraun. Every 7 years when the eye of Odin aligns with the peak of Moradin's Fist, our shaman would receive a vision from the gods. This vision would tell her who would be chosen to participate in the Asraun. The chosen would journey far beyond the village until they received their own missive from the gods. The gods would instruct those chosen to complete a quest. Each chosen is given a different quest and there's no way of knowing what to expect. Only after completing the quest can a person return to the village.

Being chosen for Langr Asraun is a great honor, but it is not without its dangers. My older brother, Hadving, was chosen 14 years ago and has not yet returned. This is not uncommon. It can take many months or even years for a person to complete the Asraun, if they ever do. Our chief himself was chosen as a young man and did not return until he was nearly old enough to be one of the elders. When the shaman announced that I was chosen, I was caught completely by surprise. I never dreamed that the gods would pick an outsider like myself. Nevertheless, I was excited to see the world that Rangrim always told me stories about.

Once I left Norheim, it was several days of traveling South before I came to the edge of the forest and then it was almost a week before I came across my first town, Kurza. The dwarves that lived there were very wary of me at first. They nearly turned the guard against me when I first arrived, but after I traded some pelts and did some odd jobs they seemed to put up with me. Things really turned a corner after I helped the guards fight off a marauding group of bandits. Turns out my time hunting in the woods prepared me pretty well for a fight. The town even let me stay in the inn after that happened. I never knew that beds existed, but I have no idea how I lived or slept without them.

I stayed in Kurza for a month before I decided it was time to move on. It was another week before I saw another person and they were far from friendly. There were a half dozen of them that captured me while I was sleeping. They dragged me further South to a mine where they sold me to the soldiers there. At first they put me to work in the mines, but after I tried to escape they put me in the fighting pit. It wasn't so bad at first, when they had me fighting wolves, boars, and other animals, but then they started sending in people. I didn't feel good about fighting the people, but they were given weapons. I knew that if I didn't kill them they would kill me and I couldn't let that happen. Not before I received my quest from the gods. So I did what I had to.

The days have begun to blend together and I've lost track of how long I've been here. The only thing that keeps me going is the thought that I'll eventually escape. And when I do, I swear on the gods, that I'll kill each and every guard here.
