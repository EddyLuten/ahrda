## **Appearance**
Solid silver eyes, indigo skin, lavender hair

## **Personality**
The pain and suffering of daily life is worth it for a hot bath and a soft bed--or some drinks and a girl. Each day you wake up
you should consider yourself lucky (growing up in Demure's Respite will teach you that), so try to live each day to the fullest
and have fun when it can be found.

## **Background**
Growing up in Avernia is interesting. Things that are discussed behind closed doors AND in hushed tones are discussed over 
drinks in a crowded bar--and everyone's doing the same thing. Venturing out into the world can be difficult for Avernian
natives, so most never leave. Lucky for me though, I developed a certain... knack. Even as a boy of 7 or 8 I could sneak things
past people, sometimes right under their noses it seemed. So I gained the attention of some unsavory types, they hepled me hone
my skills and develop even more.

I worked as a smuggler/courier for the Nessia Brotherhood, a black market facilitation group. You want drugs, they can get
them; you want someone killed, they can kill them; you want something stolen, they can steal it; you get the picture. They're
one of the middle-tier groups in Demure's Respite, a major city in Avernia. I've done all sorts of jobs, most of them within
Avernia's borders to start. After that I graduated and worked all throughout Mhur, Gerbilor, and Dau'riel--I even met someone
in the Blackfire Expanse once. The first job I work in Sivor Territory though--must have said the wrong thing to the wrong person.

tl;dr \
grew up in essentially Las Vegas on steroids, worked for an organized crime group (primarily as a smuggler)
