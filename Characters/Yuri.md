Yuri is a Dwarven Wizard in [A Darker
Heart](/A_Darker_Heart "wikilink"), set in
[Dau'riel](/Dau'riel "wikilink").

Yuri was Ren's first D\&D character ever. Originally created as a Ranger
class, Yuri was a watchtower guard for the Dwarven army. Due to his
massive member and uncanny ability to fall asleep whilst standing, his
cohorts nicknamed him "the Tripod". He was mostly remembered for an
irrational hatred of Goblins and his psychopathic tendencies.

Unfortunately, the character's adventuring career was cut short due to
the disbanding of the original group of players. Later, when members
regrouped to begin a new campaign, Yuri was passed up for [Orso
Minor](/Orso_Minor "wikilink"), then later [Straggo
De'myrn](/Straggo_De'myrn "wikilink"). However, the opportunity arose to
revive the character when a second, separate campaign began. Thus, Yuri
was reborn as a Cleric.

## **Background**

Yuri was a proud and highly-decorated soldier of the Dwarven military
stationed at Moradin's Fist. While escorting a noble and his supply
carriage to Arannashara, Yuri and a group of hand-selected adventurers
were ambushed by goblin bandits. They survived the encounter but
discovered the noble was captured during the struggle. In their attempt
to rescue the noble from the goblins' hideout located deep into Dau'riel
forests Yuri suffered crippling injuries; even after years of recovery
and magical healing, the injuries he sustained had affected his combat
prowess and left him with a limp. Because of this, Yuri developed a
deep-seated anger and hatred toward all goblinoids.

Eager to return to active duty, though no longer fit for his usual
duties, Yuri turned to the Gods in hopes of finding his purpose and
place in the world.
