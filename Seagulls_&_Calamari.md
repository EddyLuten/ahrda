## Game 1: August 14th, 2015

Each of the members of the group answered a call for security personnel
for a ship named the Half Moon, currently docked in the harbor. The
details of employment were sketchy and unspecified. However, there was a
promise of good money.

A man awaits the party on the docks, who identifies himself as Wym.
After introductions, he reveals that he's the chief of security of the
Half Moon and that they really should be going. Once aboard the ship,
they notice that the ship is very well built and maintained. Ted
identifies the wood that the ship is made of as mahogany. He knows these
things, he's from the woods. The ship is bustling with people, who seem
to be getting ready to get the ship going. Within a few minutes, the
ship sets off and the harbor is quickly out of sight.

### Arsenal and Booty

Ted asks Wym where they are going. Wym reveals that their final
destination will be [Merion](/Merion "wikilink"), but that they will
have to make a special stop in between. He can't say too much about it,
but they'll see once they get there. He also asks them not to discuss
the cargo with the rest of the crew. Wym takes the group below deck
where he shows them their sleeping quarters and the cargo hold. Most of
the cargo seems to be normal cargo, but there is a large room with a
locked door about a third of the size of the ship that he asks them to
guard. He tells them not to open the door and not to let any crew member
in, no matter how much they ask, it's very precious cargo. Before they
start their guarding job, however, Wym takes Dre and Ted above deck and
takes them into a small armory and offers Dre and Ted pistols, but they
both refuse. Mr. C comes above deck after being lured by Dr. Dre and Wym
gives him 3 pistols with a total of 35 bullets.

After some deliberation (hearing the stats for the pistols), Dre pleads
Wym for a pistol. Instead, he gives him a musket with 22 bullets.

> Ted: That is a ridiculous weapon.
> Dre: Your mother is a ridicuous weapon.
> Ted: I never knew my mother.

Wym reveals that once the mission is over and the cargo has been
delivered, each of them will get 2% of the bounty. He says that
depending on how well they do, that could mean anything from 1,000 gold
to 5,000 gold pieces. He says that along the way, depending on what
happens, there may be an opportunity for more, but it all depends on the
circumstances. The group is ordered to work, Wym says he will check on
them in an hour.

### The Old Man

Dre asks the group what they think beyond the door. Mr. C says that he
thinks there's nothing, but that they're being tested for something. Why
else would Wym ask them to guard a door below decks of a boat in the
middle of the sea? It doesn't make sense to him. Dre suggests opening
the door, Mr. C refuses since he doesn't want to fail the test. Ted goes
around the cargo bay sniffing all the sacks trying to figure out what's
in them (he also sniffs all the wood). But as he's sniffing around, he
sees a crew member walk down the cargo hold. It's a weathered old man,
who's quite muscled, Mr. C thinks he's built like that because he
masturbates furiously using both arms.

The old man tries to strike up a conversation with the "new meat," and
pretty soon starts asking about the door.

> Old man: So, what's beyond the door?
> Mr. C: What?
> Old man: What's beyond the door?
> Mr. C: I don't wanna be on the door.
> Old man: No\! What's beyond the door?
> Dre: You have not explained to me what this new meat is, is the meat
> behind the door?
> Old man: You're the new guys, newbies.
> Dre: What's a newbie?
> Old man: What's *wrong* with you?
> Dre: What's wrong with *me*? What's wrong with *you*?
> Mr. C: You can't go behind the door, we're protecting it. I don't
> know... I don't.. Go away, please.
> Old man: I'm a senior crew member you can let me in.
> Mr. C: I don't wanna see your crew member.
> Dre: If you're a senior crew member, shouldn't you know what's behind
> the door?

After some more of this stalling, the old man tries to push his way
through and take a look for himself.

> Old man: Come on, just let me take a look. I'll just be in and out
> real quick.
> Dre: That's what she said.

Becoming very uncomfortable with the old man around, Ted surrounds the
man's face with the scent of a skunk. It only reminds the old man of his
mother. Mr. C grapples the old man and pushes him back. The old man
threatens to be back later and walks off back to where he came from.
